This module adds **GS1 barcode parsing** to the Barcode suite.

It registers a GS1 parser into the `barcode_scanner` base — through the
`barcode_parsers` registry, without patching the base. Scanned GS1-128
barcodes, whether written with parenthesised application identifiers
(`(01)...(10)...`) or as raw FNC1-separated data, are decoded into structured
fields: GTIN (AI 01), batch/lot (10), serial (21), production/pack/best-before/
expiry dates (11/13/15/16/17), count (30/37), net weight and other measures
(310n–360n, with the variable weight used as the quantity), SSCC (00) and
location GLNs (410/413/414).

What each application identifier means is read from **Odoo's own GS1
nomenclature** (`barcode.nomenclature` and its rules, as shipped by the
standard *Barcode - GS1 Nomenclature* module), so a rule added or adapted in
Settings applies to the scanner too. Identifiers the nomenclature does not
define fall back to the ones built into this module, so an unknown AI in the
middle of a barcode never cuts the rest of the scan short.

Numeric identifiers — GTIN, SSCC, GLN — are only accepted when their **check
digit** matches, so a misread is reported instead of quietly resolving to the
wrong product.

Every screen then receives the parsed data alongside the raw scan, so a single
GS1 scan can identify the product and fill lot, expiry and quantity at once.
Non-GS1 codes fall through to the base EAN13 parser, so the module is safe to
install next to the rest of the suite.
